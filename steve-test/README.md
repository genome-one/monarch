This project was bootstrapped with ReactJS.

## Folder Structure

After you clone the project, your project should look like this:

```
app-name/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  public/
    index.html
    favicon.ico
  src/
    assets/
    components/
    lib/
    index.js
```
For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

* `public/index.html` is the page template;
* `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.

You can delete or rename the other files.

You may create subdirectories inside `src`. For faster rebuilds, only files inside `src` are processed by Webpack.<br>
You need to **put any JS and CSS files inside `src`**, or Webpack wonâ€™t see them.

Only files inside `public` can be used from `public/index.html`.<br>
Read instructions below for using assets from JavaScript and HTML.

You can, however, create more top-level directories.<br>
They will not be included in the production build so you can use them for things like documentation.
